This is an alarm i made for android phone using react expo go. it works well. First user enters password. Then user pushes the activate alarm button.
A timer counts from ten to zero then a a red screen appears and if the phone is moved the alarm sounds of full blast. I wanted to put an alarm on google play but I found
that you cannot lock a phone unless you install kiosk mode and to do that you have to factory reset your phone and all this and that and i dont figure users will want to do that.
So the their or outlander can just close the app or turn the volume down.
